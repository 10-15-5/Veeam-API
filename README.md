Program that can make several different changes to a Veeam database through an API.

Rough proof-of-concept at the moment but it can do such things as: Create an org/repo, create jobs for an org, display all orgs/repos/jobs and delete orgs/repos/jobs.

Very little validation done on inputs, as said this is only a proof-of-concept, and also the API error messages will display if any input is wrong anyway.
